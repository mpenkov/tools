## Time and Task Audit

> Did your actions last week match up to your priorities?
> Did you complete what you set out to do?
> Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?
> What was your allocation of $10/hour work (i.e. answering emails) vs. $10,000/hour work (i.e. building a new feature)

## Journalling

> What went well?
> Where did you get stuck?
> What did you learn?

## Planning

- [ ] Clutter: Clear your desk
- [ ] Email: Clear your inbox
- [ ] Calendar: Review schedule for next week, allocate time for important work.
- [ ] Desktop: Get rid of digital clutter by clearing out your desktop and downloads folder
- [ ] Notes: Go through all your notes and either file them away or turn them into action items
- [ ] Tasks: Clear your to-do list, set your priorities for next week, move tasks and follow-ups into next weekâ€™s list
